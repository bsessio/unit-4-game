# Crystal Collector!

We challenge you to a game of **Crystal Collector**, a game where random valued gems and crystals can be added together to try to hit the random **Crystal Number**! Overcome the challenge, and the treasure of the crystals are yours!

## Instructions
Once on the page, clicking any crystal will add a value to your current score. Each crystal has a different value between 1-12 (and every crystal changes every game!).

If you're able to add these crystals together to equal the **Crystal Number** in green (which could be any number from 19 to 120), you win the game!

However, be careful, because if you exceed the value of the **Crystal Number**, you lose!
